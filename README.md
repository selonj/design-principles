# Design Principles

## KISS (Keep it simple,stupid)
Most system work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex.

**Why?**

-   Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
-   Simplicity is ultimate sophistication.
-   It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing not left to take away.

## YAGNI

YAGNI stands for "you aren't gonna need it": don't implement something until it is necessary.

**Why?**

-   Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.
-   It leads to code bloat; the software becomes larger and more complicated.

**How?**

-   Always implement things when you **actually** need them, never when you just **foresee** that you need them.
